This code book is for the course project for the Data Cleaning Course on Coursera.

Data Description:

The data set for this project is the "Human Activity Recognition Using
Smartphones Data Set," located on the UCI Machine Learning Repository at:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The data set contains the following files:

1) 'README.txt'
2) 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
3) 'features.txt': List of all features.
4) 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
5) 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
6) 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
7) 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
8) 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.
9) 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the 
    activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
10) 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from 
    the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row 
    shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 
    'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 
11) 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal 
    obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 
12) 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector 
    measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

This project does not utilize the raw data contained in the 'Inertial Signals' folders.
It only uses the data contained with the features.txt, subject_test.txt, X_test.txt, y_test.txt, 
subject_train.txt, X_train.txt, and y_train.txt.

Data Transformation:

The primary tools for data import and transformation are found in the R packages
'dplyr' and 'tidyr.'  Each file utilized was imported with a read.table function
and transformed into a data frame with tbl_df.

In order to obtain descriptive and unique variable names information was extracted
from features.txt.  This file contains descriptive names for each variable however,
there are invalid characters and repeated names.  Therefore this header information
was transformed using make.names with the unique flag set to TRUE.  This created
the header that was then used later to apply to the test data set and training
data set.

Data containing information on the subject and activity for the raw data is contained
in separate files and therefore needed to be read in and combined with the respective
test and training data sets.  The data containing information on the activity for the
raw data is in a numerical format and thus not descriptive.  In order to transform
this data each activity was located using the 'which' function and then using
those indicies, a descriptive label was applied.  The following shows the relationship
between these values:

    1 == WALKING
    2 == WALKING_UPSTAIRS
    3 == WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
    4 == SITTING
    5 == STANDING
    6 == LAYING
    
Once the subject and activity column vectors were prepared, they were then combined
with their respective training and test data sets using 'bind_cols.'  Finally, in 
order to make the complete data set, the training and test sets were combined
using 'full_join.'

With the full data set combined and tidy, creation of the directed subsets could be
accomplished.  First a subset was created which contained the subject, activity, 
and any variable that related to a mean or standard deviation value, in total this
consisted of 10,299 observations on 88 variables.  This subsetting was accomplished
using the 'select' function.

Lastly the reduced data set was formed.  The goal was to take the average of each
variable grouped by the subject and activity being performed.  This was performed
using a combination of the 'group_by' and 'summarise_each' functions.  This resulted
in a data set containing 180 observations on 88 variables.

The R script performing these operations returns the reduced data set as well as
writes the data set to 'reducedData.txt.'
