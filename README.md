### Intro

The purpose of this script is to read in data from the UCI Machine Learning
Repository for Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set, located at: 

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

and perform various data cleaning activities.

Contained within this repository are the following:

1) UCI HAR Dataset.zip - The data set as downloadable from the UCI website.

2) UCI HAR Dataset (directory) - The extracted data set.

3) code_book.txt - A text file describing the data set and transformations performed.

4) reducedData.txt - The output text file of the final reduced data set.

5) run_analysis.R - The R script that performs and describes all actions taken.

6) README.md - This mark down file.

### Tasks
The task for this assignment contains multiple parts:

    1) Take the data and transform it into a "tidy" data set.

    2) Link the elements of this task to a Github repository.

    3) Create a code book describing the variables, data, and transformations 
        regarding this data set.

    4) Include a README.md explaing how the scripts work and are connected.

### Goals
In support of the above, the following specific activities are to be performed:

    1) Merge the training and test set to create one data set.

    2) Extract only measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each 
        measurement.

    3) Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

    4) Appropriately label data set with descriptive names.

    5) From (4), create a second independent tidy set with the average of each 
        variable for each activity and subject.
